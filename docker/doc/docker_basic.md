🔷 What is Docker?

Docker is a platform and set of tools that help you package, distribute, and run applications in containers.

A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable unit that includes everything needed to run a piece of software:
👉 code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and system tools.

It’s like a mini virtual machine, but much faster and more efficient.

🔶 Why is Docker Useful?
✅ 1. Consistency Across Environments

    “It works on my machine” — but not in production?
    Docker eliminates this problem by creating the exact same environment everywhere — local dev, testing, staging, production.

✅ 2. Lightweight & Fast

Unlike traditional virtual machines (like VirtualBox), containers share the host OS kernel and are extremely fast to start — often in milliseconds.
✅ 3. Easy Deployment

You can ship your app and all its dependencies as a Docker image. That image runs anywhere Docker is installed — cloud, server, your PC.
✅ 4. Isolation

Each container runs in isolation from others. This means you can run different versions of the same software on the same machine without conflict.
✅ 5. Scalability

Docker makes it easier to scale your app (especially in combination with orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes).
