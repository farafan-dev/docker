To install Docker on Windows Server 2025, you can follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Operating System: Windows Server 2025.
Hardware Virtualization: Ensure that hardware virtualization is enabled in your server's BIOS/UEFI settings. This is often required for Hyper-V, which can be used with Docker.
RAM: A minimum of 4 GB of RAM is recommended.
Disk Space: Ensure sufficient disk space for Docker Engine and container images.
Installation Methods
There are a few ways to install Docker on Windows Server 2025:

1. Using the Install-DockerCE.ps1 PowerShell Script
   This is a straightforward method provided by Microsoft.

Open PowerShell as Administrator: Search for "PowerShell," right-click it, and select "Run as administrator."
Run the Installation Script: Execute the following command:
Code snippet

Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-DockerCE/install-docker-ce.ps1" -o install-docker-ce.ps1
.\install-docker-ce.ps1
This script will enable the Containers feature (if not already enabled), download the Docker stable version, and install it. It might require a server reboot.
2. Installing Docker Engine from Binaries
   This method involves downloading and manually configuring the Docker Engine.

Uninstall Previous Docker Versions: If you have any previous Docker versions, uninstall them.
Disable Containers Feature (if enabled):
PowerShell

Uninstall-WindowsFeature Containers -RemoveManagementTools
Restart-Computer -Force
Enable Containers Feature:
PowerShell

Install-WindowsFeature Containers -IncludeManagementTools
Restart-Computer -Force
Download Docker Engine Binaries: Download the stable version of Docker Engine for Windows from the official Docker website or a trusted source.
Install Docker: Follow the instructions provided with the downloaded binaries to install Docker. This usually involves extracting the files to a directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Docker) and registering the Docker daemon as a Windows service.
Add Docker to Path: Add the Docker directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Docker) to your system's environment path variables.
Verify Installation: Open PowerShell and run:
PowerShell

docker version
This command should display the Docker client and server versions.
3. Using Windows Admin Center
   Windows Admin Center provides a graphical interface to manage Windows Server, including installing and managing containers.

Install Windows Admin Center: If you haven't already, download and install Windows Admin Center.
Connect to Your Server: Add your Windows Server 2025 instance to Windows Admin Center.
Install Containers Extension: In Windows Admin Center, go to Settings > Extensions and install the latest Containers extension.
Install Docker: Select your server in Windows Admin Center, and under Tools, find Containers. Click Install. Windows Admin Center will handle the background installation of Docker.
Post-Installation Steps
Start the Docker Service: Ensure the Docker service is running. You can manage services using the services.msc console or PowerShell:
PowerShell

Start-Service Docker
Configure Docker (Optional): You can configure the Docker Engine by editing the daemon.json file, typically located in C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\.
Test Docker: Run a simple container to verify the installation:
PowerShell

docker run --name test-container -d mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2025 ping -t 8.8.8.8
Then, check if the container is running:
PowerShell

docker ps
To stop and remove the test container:
PowerShell

docker stop test-container
docker rm test-container
Important Considerations
Container Isolation: Windows Server supports two types of container isolation:
Process Isolation: Provides isolation between containers and the host operating system. This is the default.
Hyper-V Isolation: Runs each container in a highly optimized virtual machine, providing stronger isolation. To use Hyper-V isolation, the Hyper-V role must be installed. You can specify the isolation mode when running a container using the --isolation flag (e.g., docker run --isolation=hyperv ...).
Base Images: When working with Windows containers, you'll need to use Windows-based container images. Microsoft provides base images like mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2025 and mcr.microsoft.com/windows/server:ltsc2025. Ensure the base image version is compatible with your Windows Server 2025 host.
Docker Desktop: Note that Docker Desktop is primarily designed for development on Windows 10 and 11 and is not supported on Windows Server versions like 2025 for running server containers in production environments. The methods described above are the recommended ways to install Docker Engine on Windows Server.
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully install and start using Docker on your Windows Server 2025 machine. Remember to consult the official Docker and Microsoft documentation for the most up-to-date information and advanced configuration options.
